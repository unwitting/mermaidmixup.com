            <p>Welcome to the mixup! MermaidMixup is a shop with a simple goal: pretty, queer things with accessible pricing. Everything is designed by Juniper, a trans woman in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

            <p>Things work a little differently here. Everything we sell comes with <strong>three price points</strong> and <strong>zero judgement</strong>.</p>
            <p>Can't afford much? Choose the "pay less" option, no questions asked. All we ask is that you exercise your honesty and choose the "standard" option if you can afford it: this helps keep MermaidMixup accessible for everybody.</p>
            <p>And if you really fancy it, you can choose the "treat me to a coffee" price, which puts a smile on my face and funds more time spent creating cool new things for the shop.</p>
